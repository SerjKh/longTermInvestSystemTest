Here I will write a plan for a long term investment test program.
Will use russel 3000, which represents 98% of US market
First need to understand where I can download data for russel 3000 as far at least for 20 years.

Seems that yahoo/google cannot provide historical fundamental data.
Quandl resource can, but for 10 years back and may be will cost 50$.
Have a problem to install numpy/pandas at my desktop.
